# Analyzing the Relationship Between Incarceration Rates and Household Income

## Background

Over the past few decades, America's prisoner population has skyrocketed to over [2.2 million inmates](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html), the highest per capita imprisonment rate in the entire world. This trend of mass incarceration, which began in the 1970s, has disprortionately affected poor, black communities such as the Fairfield Area in Baltimore, and the housing projects of Southeast D.C. Many of these areas already face the obstacles of an underprivileged schooling system and high-risk neighborhoods - higher incarceration rates serve to further perpetuate the lack of social mobility experienced by these communities.

The cities of Baltimore, Maryland and Washington, D.C. present similar examples of underprivileged, metropolitan communities. Using data provided by [The Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/), this project will analyze the relationship between incarceration rates and household incomes in different areas in both cities, and compare the resulting data. In particular, I'll be examining whether the expected positive relationship is visibile in the data, and if there are any discrepancies between the imprisonment trends of the two cities.

I chose to examine this particular metric because I recently finished Michelle Alexander's _The New Jim Crow_, which provides a detailed recount of the caste-like imprisonment system instituted by the U.S. Government over the last few decades. My hometown is technically Potomac, MD, but the data from my area wasn't significant enough to compare with Baltimore, so I decided to use D.C. instead.

## Business Question
